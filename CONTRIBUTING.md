# How to contribute a code

Please follow following rules:

* This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). \
  Most common commit types are: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `ci`, but feel free to use any standard type.
* Include Jira issue ID as a scope, if possible: `fix(AB-123): this is it`
* Each Pull Request must contain explanation what it does, and why it should be incorporated in this repository.
* Pull Request title must also follow conventional commits syntax.
* Complex Pull Requests containing multiple commits should be Squashed, unless its commit history
  should be retained. Use Rebase in such case. Use Merge only if necessary.
* All new code must be properly tested, documented, and compliant with all linters.
